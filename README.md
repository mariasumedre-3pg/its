ITS rewrite

ITS (Image Transform Service) performs transformations on images by accepting transform requests in the form of query strings. 

## Fit

There are three varieties of fit -- default, focal and smart fit.

*Default*

The default fit crops the input image about the center of the image. To use this crop, use the crop keyword with two arguments split by x's:

>API_URL/<file_path/filename.ext>?fit=WWxHH

Where:
* fit -- indicates that ITS should perform a fit and use the middle of the image as the focal point for the fit.
* WW -- a numerical pixel value representing the desired width of the output image
* HH -- a numerical pixel value representing the desired height of the output image

Example

>API_URL/demo/citizen_kane.jpg?fit=1000x1000

Result Image: ![Citizen-Kane-Crop-1000x1000](http://i.imgur.com/meMAv8Q.jpg)

*Focal*

Focal fit returns an image focused around a user-specified point in the original image of a user-specified size. To use this fit, utilize the fit keyword with four arguments split by x's:

>API_URL/<file_path/filename.ext>?fit=WWxHHxXXxYY

Where:
* fit -- indicates that ITS should perform a crop
* WW -- a numerical pixel value representing the desired width of the output image
* HH -- a numerical pixel value representing the desired height of the output image
* XX -- the x axis of the focal point, represented as a percentage value of the height of the original picture
* YY -- the y axis of the focal point, represented as a percentage value of the height of the original picture

Example

>API_URL/demo/citizen_kane.jpg?fit=1000x1000x15x30

Result Image: ![Citizen-Kane-Focal-1000x1000x15x30](http://i.imgur.com/U3gdnmf.jpg)

*Smart*

Smart fit returns an image focused around a user-specified point in the original image of a user-specified size. To use this fit, the crop keyword and include the focal parameters in the filename of the input image: 

>API_URL/<file_path/filename_focus-XXxYY.ext>?fit=WWxHH

Where:
* fit -- indicates that ITS should perform a crop
* HH -- a numerical pixel value representing the desired height of the output image
* XX -- the x axis of the focal point, represented as a percentage value of the height of the original picture
* YY -- the y axis of the focal point, represented as a percentage value of the height of the original picture

Example

Result Image: ![Citizen-Kane-Smart-1000x1000x50x15](http://i.imgur.com/5w5e8lR.jpg)

## Overlay

Overlay returns the input image with the specified overlay image placed on top of it. The overlay is placed according to the expected position of its top left corner as input by the user. To use overlay, use the overlay keyword:

>API_URL/<file_path/filename.ext>?overlay=PXxPYx<overlay_img_path>

Where:
* overlay -- indicates that ITS should put an overlay on the input image
* overlay_img_path -- path to the overlay (optionally, can be a keyword a keyword in the OVERLAYS dictionary in settings)
* PX -- the x axis of the top left corner of the overlay image,  represented as a percentage value of the height of the original picture (default is 50%)
* PY -- the y axis of the top left corner of the overlay image, represented as a percentage value of the height of the original picture (default is 50%)

## Resize

Resize returns a resized version of the original image without distortion of the aspect ratio. To use it, use the resize keyword:

>API_URL/<file_path/filename.ext>?resize=WWxHH

Where:
* resize -- indicates that ITS should perform a resize transform
* WW -- a numerical pixel value representing the desired width of the output image
* HH -- a numerical pixel value representing the desired height of the output image

Note: Resizing to a larger size isn’t recommended, as it will compromise image quality.
Note: Inputing a single value (either an expected width size or an expected height size followed by an 'x') is also supported.

Example

>API_URL/demo/citizen_kane.jpg?resize=700x400

Result Image: ![Citizen-Kane-Resize-700x400](http://i.imgur.com/CItOntv.jpg)

## Format

Format returns the input image in the specified type, rather than being left as the original image’s type. It currently supports conversion to JPG, PNG, and WEBP. To use it, use the format keyword:

>API_URL/<file_path/filename.ext>?format=<ext>>&quality=<integer>

Where:
* format -- indicates that ITS should perform a format transform
* ext -- the requested output type. Can only be JPG, PNG or WEBP
* quality -- *optional*, allows user to specify the quality that they would like the output image to have. Currently, this parameter only works with PNG and JPG outputs. Accepts a multiple 10 up to 100.

Example

>API_URL/demo/citizen_kane.jpg?format=png&quality=10

Result Image: ![Citizen-Kane-PNG-10](http://i.imgur.com/CItOntv.jpg)


## Combination
All of the transforms described above can be combined into one query by separating them with ‘&’.

Example
The following query resizes the input JPG image, applies an overlay to it:
